> Introduction 🏁

Web scraping is the process of extracting and parsing data from websites in an automated fashion using a computer program. It's a useful technique for creating datasets for research and learning.

For this project, I would scrape books information using python from the website Books to Scrape, a fictional bookstore for learners and developers validating their scraping technologies.

> Python Libraries 🐍

* Requests : To download and save web pages locally
* BeautifulSoup : To parse and explore the structure of downloaded web pages
* Pandas : To transform the data into Dataframe

> Project Outline 🛣

* Examining the Books to Scrape website.
* Reading the web page into python using Requests library.
* Inspecting the tags to gather the required information.
* For each book, we'll grab title, Price, Stock, UPC (universal product code) & link.
* Create a data frame using Pandas library.
* Finally, saving the information into a CSV file.

> Output 📝

Dataset containing information about 1000 books.
